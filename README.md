# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 
My main project idea is to build a Music Theory Learning Module. This would be similar to Duolingo's approach but specialized for jazz theory (as this is the specific portion of music I am interested in).

For this hack-a-thing assignment, I got my hands dirty in creating a small web-app, focusing on the React technology and and Tone.js for the musical component. My inititial idea is creating a playable mini-piano with keys, and guessing the audio note by selecting the correct key. I plan to improve my UI/UX skills, maybe with an animation that visualizes the sound waves for each chord.


Include some screenshots.
